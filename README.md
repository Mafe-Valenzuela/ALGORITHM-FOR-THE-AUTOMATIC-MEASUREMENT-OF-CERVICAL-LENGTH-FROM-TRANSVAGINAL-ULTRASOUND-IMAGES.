# ALGORITHM-FOR-THE-AUTOMATIC-MEASUREMENT-OF-CERVICAL-LENGTH-FROM-TRANSVAGINAL-ULTRASOUND-IMAGES.
This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of the mid-third of the cervix and the measurement of cervical length (CL) from transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) images.
